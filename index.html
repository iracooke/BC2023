<h1>Bioinformatics Tutorial Exercises</h1>

<p>Developed by Ira Cooke for BC2023, James Cook University</p>

<p>This subject includes five bioinformatics tutorials designed to introduce some of the core skills required for manipulating large biological sequence datasets. The tutorials are based around the <em>central dogma</em> of biology and will demonstrate how to translate a large number of RNA sequences into their corresponding proteins.</p>

<p>All of the tutorials take the form of an interactive notebook which you can access using a web browser.  These notebooks include all of the instructions for completing each tutorial and include space for you to add your answers. For tutorials 1-4, self-assessment exercises are provided to help you track your progress.  The final notebook (tutorial 5) must be submitted for assessment.</p>

<p>Most programs for analysis of large biological sequence datasets use a text based interface called the <em>command line</em>.  We will learn one of the most commonly used command line environments called <em>bash</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bourne Again Shell</a>.  The best way to learn bash is to play around and type commands.  To help you do this we&#39;ve built an interactive website that guides you through the most useful commands and gives you access to a bash shell where you can experiment with them.  This website forms the <em>textbook</em> for these tutorials.  It is accessible at <a href="https://bc2023.bioinformatics.guide">http://bc2023.bioinformatics.guide</a></p>

<p>Prior to each bioinformatics workshop you should work through the relevant sections of <a href="https://bc2023.bioinformatics.guide">the guide</a> (see table below)</p>
