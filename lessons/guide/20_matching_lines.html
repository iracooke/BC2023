      <h2 id="20-matching-lines-in-files-with-grep">20: Matching lines in files with grep</h2>
<p>You will often want to search files to find lines that match a certain pattern. The Unix command <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> does this (and much more). </p>
<p>First change directory to <code>example_data</code>. </p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">learner@:~$ cd example_data
</code></pre>
<p>The following examples show how you can use grep&#39;s command-line options to:</p>
<ul>
<li>show lines that match a specified pattern</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">learner@:example_data$ grep &#39;was&#39; opening_lines.txt
The Galactic Empire was dying.                                                    
It was a pleasure to burn.                                                        
It was a bright, cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.        
It was love at first sight.                                                       
It was the day my grandmother exploded.                                           
When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow.
Marley was dead, to begin with.
