The path length can be easily measured (size of the vessel holding our sample), and absorbance is measured by the spectrophotometer. The remaining variable, $\\epsilon$ is a characteristic of the DNA that we are measuring.  For a short oligonucleotide sequence it can vary alot depending on the sequence of DNA bases (A, C, G, T). \n",

    "A convenient and fairly accurate method for calculating $\\epsilon$ is the nearest neighbour method.  Under the nearest neighbour method $\\epsilon$ for an oligo (single stranded DNA) of length $N$ nucleotides is calculated according to the formula:\n",

    "First let's calculate the contribution from the nearest neighbour pairs.  In `AGGCT` the nearest neighbour pairs are `AG`, `GG`, `GC` and `CT` as shown below\n",

    "\n",
    "The nearest neighbour contribution is the sum of these which gives:\n",
